Welcome to **GhostWhisper**, the stealthy-yet-flexible modular CLI messaging tool designed for researchers and developers who want full control and traceability over their messaging workflows.

---

## Features

- Modular architecture with pluggable transports (HTTP, SMTP, QR, Localpipe)
- Clean CLI interface with `send` and `listen` commands
- Robust message serialization and deserialization
- Automatic routing with fallback transports for reliability
- Detailed development logging to `ghostwhisper-devlog.txt` for research-grade traceability
- Extensible core for future transport and feature additions
- Thoroughly tested with unit and integration tests

---

## Installation

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Make sure you have Python 3.11+ installed.

---

## Usage

```bash
ghostwhisper send --to http://localhost --via http --message "Hello, world!"
ghostwhisper listen --via http
```

*Note:* The `listen` command is currently a stub and will be fully implemented in upcoming phases.

---

## Roadmap

- Phase 2: FastAPI-based receiver and full listen mode implementation
- Add real SMTP, QR code, and localpipe transports
- Key management and encryption support
- Enhanced logging and analytics
- GUI and WSL compatibility checks
